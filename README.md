# The Great RGB Color Game

## Intro

In my efforts to learn how to properly do frontend, I found this idea for a quick game to guess colors based on their `rgb` codes. 

It is a very simple project that uses vanilla `javascript` to do the work.
It displays squares with randomly generated colors and the aim is to find the correct one using its rgb code.
